# Balance Check

Synced from `.claude/skills/balance-check/SKILL.md`.

## Codex Notes

- Invoke this workflow with `$balance-check`.
- Ask choice questions directly in conversation using 2-4 labeled options.
- For role-specific delegation, load `.codex/references/agents/<role>.md` on demand instead of relying on Claude-only agent types.
- Read `.claude/docs/coordination-rules.md` and `.claude/docs/review-workflow.md` when the work crosses domains.

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Identify the balance domain** from the argument.

2. **Read relevant data files** from `assets/data/` and `design/balance/`.

3. **Read the design document** for the system being checked from `design/gdd/`.

4. **Perform analysis**:

   For **combat balance**:
   - Calculate DPS for all weapons/abilities at each power tier
   - Check time-to-kill at each tier
   - Identify any options that dominate all others (strictly better)
   - Check if defensive options can create unkillable states
   - Verify damage type/resistance interactions are balanced

   For **economy balance**:
   - Map all resource faucets and sinks with flow rates
   - Project resource accumulation over time
   - Check for infinite resource loops
   - Verify gold sinks scale with gold generation
   - Check if any items are never worth purchasing

   For **progression balance**:
   - Plot the XP curve and power curve
   - Check for dead zones (no meaningful progression for too long)
   - Check for power spikes (sudden jumps in capability)
   - Verify content gates align with expected player power
   - Check if skip/grind strategies break intended pacing

   For **loot balance**:
   - Calculate expected time to acquire each rarity tier
   - Check pity timer math
   - Verify no loot is strictly useless at any stage
   - Check inventory pressure vs acquisition rate

5. **Output the analysis**:
